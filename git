Usual Git Workflow

git add .
git commit -m "message"

GULP

- installed Node in order to use NPM (how we bring outside code into our app)
- npm i gulp browser-sync gulp-cli
- added gitignore so that node_moduels wouldn't be pushed up to github
- copy and pasted gulpfile.js and added to project
- ran gulp serve to start the live server
